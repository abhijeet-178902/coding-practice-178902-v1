//A student misses the bus and has to walk all the way from home to school. //The distance from home to school is D units.
//The student starts his journey with the initial energy of K units. 
//The energy of the student decreases by 1 unit for every unit of distance walked. 
//On the way to school, there is N juice stalls. 
//Each stall has a specific amount of juice in liters. The energy of students increased by 1 unit for every liter of juice they consumes. Note that in order to keep walking the student should non-zero energy.
//Write an algorithm to help the student in figuring out the minimum number of juice stalls at which they should stop to successfully reach the school. // in case the student can't reach the school the output will be -1
//expected output: Print the integer representing the minimum number of juice stalls at the which the student should stop to reach the school successfully.


//The first line of input consists of an integer - numStalls,representing the number of juice stalls(N). 
//The second line consists of N-space separated integers-dist0, dist1â€¦
//distn representing the distance of the nth stall from the student's home. //The third line consists of an integer numzS, representing the number of stall for available juices(M is always equal to N). 
//The fourth line consists of M space-separated integer lit0, lit1....litn, representing the liters of juice available at ith stall.
//The fifth line consists of an integer -distance representing the distance of the school from student's home(D). 
// the last line consists of integer intEnergy, representing the initial energy ofstudent(K).

//First Input : 3
//Second Input: 5, 7, 10
//Third input: 3
//Fourth Input: 2 3 5 
//Fifth Input: 15
//Sixth Input: 5

//expected Output: 3
